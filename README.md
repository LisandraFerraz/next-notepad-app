# Notes App - An easier way to keep important infos organized

The project is mainly focused on the practice and understand of DOM manipulation using Next.js.

With the tools providaded by the APP, the user is allowed to customize their own texts and manage the notes written by styling the texts and keep the notes saved locally.

![Design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d048734e-0ed9-440d-ab77-3924a1ff0233)

In order to focus on the frontend development, the notes are kept on the user's local storage and all filters and processes happen on the client side.

Though it is front-end focused, the architecture allows API responses according to the models and its predefined properties.
